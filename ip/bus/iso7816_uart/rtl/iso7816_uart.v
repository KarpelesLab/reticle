// iso7816_uart — the character layer of an ISO/IEC 7816-3 smart card
// interface, from the **terminal's** side.
//
// Everything this block believes about the protocol is **QUOTED** from
// ISO/IEC 7816-3 as it was described to this project, and **nothing here
// has been near a card or a part**. README.md says so where a reader
// cannot miss it, and its §2 is the list of the standard's own questions
// that this block had to answer by decision rather than by reading.
//
// What it does
//   One character at a time, on one wire, half duplex.
//
//   A character is QUOTED as: one start bit (low, 1 etu), eight data
//   bits, a parity bit **making the count of ones in those nine bits
//   even**, then a guard time of at least 2 etu during which the line is
//   high. That is the "8E2" a user of this block will call it. The etu —
//   the elementary time unit — is the bit period; on a card it is F/D
//   cycles of the card clock, which at the default F=372, D=1 and an
//   8 MHz clock is 21505 baud, and after a successful PPS exchange F/D
//   shrinks and the rate rises.
//
//   **The rate is a run-time input in system clock cycles**, not in card
//   clocks: `etu_div` is clocks per etu, which is `ip/bus/uart`'s `div`
//   convention and keeps every divisor a whole number.
//
//   On the intended board the system clock is **112 MHz**, chosen because
//   it divides by an even number to every card clock the owner wants — 8,
//   7, 5.6, 4, 3.5, 2, 1.75 and 1 MHz, at divisors 14, 16, 20, 28, 32,
//   56, 64 and 112 — so the card clock's duty cycle is exactly half at
//   every one. `etu_div` is then `(F/D) * divisor` and is an exact whole
//   number at every rate: 372 * 14 = **5208** for the default F/D at
//   8 MHz, which is 21505 baud, and 4 * 14 = **56** for F/D = 4 at the
//   same card clock, which is 2 Mbaud. Moving between them needs no
//   rebuild — a PPS exchange is exactly the design that cannot have its
//   rate compiled in. `etu_div` is read **once per character**, when a
//   byte is accepted or when a start edge is found, so a character in
//   flight keeps the rate it started at and a change takes effect from
//   the next character. That is the only definition under which a rate
//   change never corrupts a byte, and it is the rule `uart_frame_tx`
//   measured and this block copies.
//
//   **The card clock and the activation and reset sequence are not
//   here.** This is the character layer: a separate block drives CLK,
//   RST and VCC, and the division of labour is deliberate.
//
// The wire, and why `io_o` is a constant
//   QUOTED: the contact is one wire, half duplex, **open drain**. It
//   idles high through a pull-up; a transmitter pulls it low for a zero
//   and *releases* it for a one.
//
//   So the pad interface is `io_oe` and a **constant** `io_o`. The block
//   either pulls the contact to one level or lets go of it; it never
//   drives both, which is what lets the terminal and the card share one
//   wire without contention, and it is a structural property rather than
//   a promise: `io_o` is an `assign` of a parameter and no path reaches
//   it. `io_i` is the line as the pad reads it, synchronised here through
//   two flops before anything looks at it, because it is asynchronous to
//   `clk` by definition.
//
//   Three parameters put the **polarity of each of those three wires**
//   where a board needs it, because the pad is not always what drives the
//   contact: a discrete transistor pulling it down inverts, and so does a
//   buffer with an active-low enable. `OE_INVERT`, `OUT_INVERT` and
//   `IN_INVERT` are one exclusive or each and they are independent,
//   because the three paths are independent — an external pull-down FET
//   changes the output's sense while the input still taps the contact
//   directly. One parameter beats a second block.
//
// `active`, and why releasing the line is the safe state
//   The terminal switches the card's **VCC** through an external
//   high-side switch, so that it can do a proper cold reset, and the
//   ordering of that is mandated: VCC up, then CLK, then RST released,
//   and in reverse on the way down — RST low, CLK stopped low, **IO
//   released**, then VCC off. Driving a pin into an unpowered device
//   forward-biases its ESD diodes and can partially power it or damage
//   it, so "IO released before VCC drops" is a **hazard requirement** and
//   not a nicety.
//
//   The sequencer that owns that ordering is a separate block. What this
//   one provides is a way to be held **inert** so that sequencer can own
//   the line: `active` low releases the wire, idles the transmitter,
//   refuses a byte (`tx_ready` is low), abandons anything in flight with
//   `tx_abort`, and holds the receiver from starting a character. It
//   takes effect on the clock after `active` falls, because `active` is
//   registered — one system clock, against a VCC switch whose slew is
//   microseconds.
//
//   **Releasing the line is the safe state**, and that is the whole
//   reason this works: an open-drain bus idles high through its pull-up,
//   so a released line is indistinguishable from an idle one to the far
//   end. There is no bus turnaround to get wrong and no level being
//   driven at a device that is about to lose its supply.
//
//   **Coming out of it must not invent a character**, which is the trap
//   `ip/bus/spi_display_rx/README.md` §3a is the account of: an edge
//   compared against a register that was never loaded from a pin. Two
//   things make it safe here. The input synchroniser **keeps running**
//   while the block is inert, so it is never showing a reset value when
//   `active` rises; and `settle_sr` is held cleared while inert, so for
//   three clocks after `active` rises no edge is taken at all — by which
//   time both halves of the comparison were sampled while active, and an
//   edge that happened on an unpowered contact has passed out of the
//   window.
//
// The two conventions, and why it is a port
//   QUOTED. The terminal learns the convention by decoding the first ATR
//   byte TS at run time, so it cannot be a parameter:
//
//     direct  (TS = 0x3B)  a logic one is **high**, and the data bits
//                          arrive **least significant first**.
//     inverse (TS = 0x3F)  a logic one is **low**, and the data bits
//                          arrive **most significant first**. Both the
//                          polarity and the bit order invert.
//
//   The start bit is a *level* and not a logic value: the line is pulled
//   low for 1 etu in both conventions. So the two differ only over the
//   nine bits after it, and the arithmetic that falls out of that is the
//   whole of this block's convention handling:
//
//     * electrically, the inverse frame is the direct frame's data bits
//       **reversed and then complemented**, parity bit included;
//     * even parity over nine *logic* ones, complemented an odd number of
//       times, becomes **odd** parity over the nine bits on the wire. So
//       the check is `(^nine_bits) == convention` and not two checks —
//       one exclusive or and one comparison.
//
//   A block that inverted the polarity and forgot the bit order, or the
//   other way round, would still pass a test whose bytes happen to be
//   bit-symmetric or self-complementary; `iso7816_uart_tb.v`'s bytes are
//   neither, and it decodes one captured frame **all four ways** and
//   asserts that only the full inverse reading matches.
//
// T=0 parity error signalling
//   QUOTED: a receiver that sees bad parity pulls the line low for 1 to
//   2 etu starting 10.5 etu after the start bit's falling edge, and the
//   transmitter samples at about 11.5 etu and repeats the character if it
//   finds the line low.
//
//   Both halves are implemented, behind `PARITY_RETRY` so a link that
//   wants neither can have neither. This block drives a **2 etu** pulse,
//   the long end of the permitted range, because the two ends measure
//   10.5 and 11.5 etu from their own detection of the same edge and each
//   is late by its own synchroniser: a 2 etu pulse then covers the far
//   end's sample point for any `etu_div` at or above five, and `DIV_MIN`
//   is eight. README.md §4 has that arithmetic.
//
//   A character that failed its parity check is still **delivered**, with
//   `rx_parity_error` beside it, which is what `uart_frame_rx` does and
//   for the same reason: a wrong byte at a consumer is more informative
//   than silence, and the repeat arrives afterwards as a second
//   character. `rx_char_count` therefore counts characters and
//   `parity_error_count` the bad ones, so both stay comparable against a
//   driven total.
//
//   A transmitted character is repeated at most `MAX_REPEAT` times. The
//   standard as this project was given it fixes no limit, and a block
//   that repeated for ever would be the hang this interface exists not to
//   have, so the limit is a parameter and giving up raises `tx_abort`.
//
// Guard time and waiting time
//   QUOTED: the guard time beyond the mandatory 2 etu is TC1 from the
//   ATR, 0 to 254 extra etu, so `guard_etu` is a run-time input. The
//   obligation QUOTED is on the *interval between the leading edges of
//   two consecutive characters*, whichever direction each went in, so
//   this block holds `tx_ready` low for `2 + guard_etu` etu after **any**
//   character and not only after one of its own.
//
//   QUOTED: a card that never answers must become a reported timeout.
//   `wt_etu` is the waiting time in etu; the timer is armed when a
//   character ends in either direction, disarmed by the next start edge
//   or by a transmission, and `rx_timeout` strobes for one cycle when it
//   expires. `wt_etu` of zero disables it. One strobe per arming, so a
//   link that has simply finished talking produces one timeout and not a
//   stream of them — README.md §2 is honest that "when does the terminal
//   stop expecting a character" is a question about the *transport* layer
//   that this block cannot answer.
//
// What it does not do
//   No card clock, no activation, no reset, no VCC or VPP control, no ATR
//   decoding (so nothing here chooses the convention, the guard time or
//   the waiting time — it is told them), no PPS exchange, no T=0 or T=1
//   transport layer, no waiting time extension, no FIFO, and no
//   clock-stop handling. It is the character layer, and the bytes it
//   hands up and takes down are somebody else's protocol.
