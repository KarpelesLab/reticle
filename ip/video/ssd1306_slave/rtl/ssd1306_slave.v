// An SSD1306-compatible mono display, as a slave: it decodes the command
// set, keeps the display memory, and lets something else read it out.
//
// What it is for: a part that pretends to be a 128x64 OLED so that a
// driver written for one can be developed, watched and tested without the
// glass — or so that the pixels a real driver would have drawn can be
// captured and sent somewhere else. The frame buffer is readable, and a
// strobe says when a whole frame has been written, so a host can take a
// copy after each redraw.
//
// What it is NOT: a controller for a real panel, and not a transport. It
// takes **bytes with a command/data tag**, not wires, so the link is
// somebody else's problem:
//
//   `ip/bus/spi_display_rx`  four-wire SPI, which is what an SSD1306 in
//                            4-wire mode uses
//   anything else             I2C, a parallel bus, a test fixture, a CPU
//                            writing bytes — all the same to this block
//
// That split is deliberate. The protocol and the wire are independent
// questions and mixing them would make this block untestable without a
// serial link and unusable behind any other one.
//
// ===================================================================
// WHAT IS QUOTED AND WHAT IS CHECKED
// ===================================================================
//
// The command set below is **QUOTED** from the Solomon Systech SSD1306
// datasheet revision 1.1, section 10 ("Command Table") and section 8.7
// ("Graphic Display Data RAM"). Nothing here has been checked against a
// real SSD1306, because the point of the block is to stand in for one;
// what has been checked is that it behaves as the datasheet describes,
// and `ssd1306_slave_tb.v` is that check — it drives the initialisation
// sequence a real driver sends, writes known pixels, and reads the memory
// back.
//
// **No part has run this.** When one has, this header says so.
//
// ===================================================================
// THE DISPLAY MEMORY, AND WHY IT IS PAGES
// ===================================================================
//
// An SSD1306's memory is not a bitmap in scanline order. It is `PAGES`
// pages of `COLUMNS` bytes, and **each byte is eight vertically stacked
// pixels** — bit 0 the topmost. So the pixel at (x, y) is bit `y % 8` of
// the byte at page `y / 8`, column `x`, which is address
// `page * COLUMNS + column`.
//
// For 128x64 that is 8 pages of 128 bytes: 1024 bytes, which fits in one
// `RAMB18E1` on a 7-series part with room to spare. A reader that wants
// scanlines has to transpose, and doing that here would be inventing a
// format no SSD1306 driver speaks.
//
// ===================================================================
// THE ADDRESS POINTER
// ===================================================================
//
// Every data byte is written at the pointer, which then advances. How it
// advances is the addressing mode (command 0x20):
//
//   0  HORIZONTAL  column++; at the column window's end, back to its
//                  start and page++; at the page window's end, back to
//                  its start. This is what nearly every driver uses to
//                  push a whole frame.
//   1  VERTICAL    page++; at the page window's end, back to its start
//                  and column++; at the column window's end, back to its
//                  start.
//   2  PAGE        column++ only, wrapping within the page at COLUMNS.
//                  The page changes only when told to (0xB0..0xB7). This
//                  is the power-on mode and the one the old `0x00..0x0F`
//                  and `0x10..0x1F` column commands are for.
//
// The windows are set by 0x21 (column start, end) and 0x22 (page start,
// end) and default to the whole display.
//
// ===================================================================
// WHEN A FRAME IS DONE
// ===================================================================
//
// `frame_done` is a one-cycle strobe, and it fires when the pointer
// **wraps back to the start of both windows** — which in horizontal mode
// is exactly the moment a full frame has been written. That is the signal
// to take a copy.
//
// It is not a guess about timing and it needs no idle detector: a driver
// that writes 1024 bytes in horizontal mode produces exactly one strobe,
// whatever rate it writes at and however the bytes are split across
// transfers. In page mode a driver that fills all eight pages also
// produces one, on the last wrap. A driver that writes part of the screen
// produces none, which is correct — nothing was redrawn.
//
// `frame_count` counts the strobes.
//
// ===================================================================
// WHAT IT DOES WITH A COMMAND IT DOES NOT KNOW
// ===================================================================
//
// Counts it in `unknown_cmds` and otherwise ignores it, which is what a
// real SSD1306 does with most of the reserved space. The counter exists
// so that a driver using a command this block has not implemented is a
// number somebody can read rather than a silent misbehaviour — the same
// reason every other counter here exists.
//
// A multi-byte command whose argument never arrives leaves the block
// waiting for it, exactly as a real one would, and `pending_args` is
// visible so that a stuck sequence can be seen.
