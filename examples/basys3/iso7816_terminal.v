// A working ISO 7816 terminal on a Digilent Basys 3: activate a card, read
// its answer, negotiate a faster rate, then talk to it — all from a host
// over the board's serial port.
//
// `iso7816_probe.v` beside this one only listens, which was enough to prove
// the wiring, the clock, the supply switch, the reset timing and the
// character framing against a real device. This one transmits as well, so
// it can do the two things that needed a transmitter: the PPS exchange that
// raises the rate, and sending command bytes afterwards.
//
// **This module has no serial port of its own.** It takes received bytes
// and gives characters to send, and something above it owns the pins:
// `iso7816_terminal_pad.v` for a board that does nothing else, or
// `iso_display.v` where this core and `ssd1306_console.v` share one port
// through an arbiter. That split exists because the board has one serial
// port and a card that must be initialised and then driven cannot be split
// across two bitstreams — reloading the part drops `vcc_en` and
// power-cycles the device.

// THE CONVERSATION
// ===================================================================
//
//   A          activate: power, clock, hold reset 400 card clocks, release
//   P          send PPS `FF 10 97 78` (`PPS1`). The card's echo comes back as hex
//              like anything else; **the host compares it**, and sends `F`
//              if it agrees.
//   F          switch to the fast rate. `S` switches back.
// A byte printed with `>` in front came from the monitor, a second receiver
// on this contact that never drives it -- so it is what this terminal itself
// put on the wire. A byte with no prefix came from the card. `!` means the
// parity was wrong, whichever receiver saw it.
//
//   L          drive the line low for 18 ms, read it, release, read again:
//              `+PAD` if it went low and came back high, `-PAD` otherwise.
//              This is the only check that the pad drives at all, as
//              opposed to this design believing it transmitted.
//   :<hex>     send those bytes to the card. `:00A4040C` sends four. Hex
//              until anything that is not a hex digit ends it, so a newline
//              is a fine terminator.
//   D          deactivate: reset, clock, line, then power — in that order
//   s          status
//
// `A`, `C`, `D` and `F` are themselves hex digits, which is why sending
// bytes needs the `:` prefix: inside a `:` run every character is data,
// outside it every character is a command. Without that, `:0A` and a
// request to activate would be indistinguishable.
//
// **That rule is enforced, and for a while it was not.** Every command
// decoder used to look at the received byte alone, so the uppercase digits
// inside a run ran their commands as well — see the gate near the top of
// the module for what that did and how it was found. A run ends at the
// first character that is not a hex digit, and that character is the
// terminator and nothing else: end a run with CR, LF or a space.
//
// Everything the card says comes back as two hex characters per byte, with
// `!` before a byte whose parity was wrong, and a CRLF once the line has
// been idle for `GAP_ETU` etu. Banners mark what the terminal did:
//
//   +VCC +CLK +RST   the activation sequence, step by step
//   +FST             the rate is now the fast one, from `F`
//   +SLW             back to the default, from `S`
//   -OFF             deactivated
//
// ===================================================================
// THE RATE, AND WHY BOTH VALUES ARE EXACT
// ===================================================================
//
// An etu is `F/D` card clock cycles, so in system cycles it is
// `(F/D) * CARD_DIV` — an integer at every rate this board offers, because
// 112 MHz was chosen so that every card frequency is an even integer
// division of it:
//
//   /14 = 8 MHz   /16 = 7   /20 = 5.6   /28 = 4
//   /32 = 3.5     /56 = 2   /64 = 1.75  /112 = 1
//
// Before PPS, `F/D` is 372: etu = 372 * 14 = **5208** system cycles, which
// is 21505 baud. After the PPS this sends, `F/D` is 8: etu = 8 * 14 =
// **112**, which is 1 Mbaud. Changing `CARD_DIV` changes both rates together and
// keeps both exact, which is the whole reason the etu is expressed in card
// cycles rather than in a baud number.
//
// **The card offers `TA1 = 87`, and this asks for `97`.** `DI = 7` is Di =
// 64 as the standard says, but **`FI = 8` is RFU** in ISO 7816-3's Fi table;
// the device's own documentation and its owner make it `F/D = 4`, 2 Mbaud.
// That was the first PPS this sent, and at 2 Mbaud a card byte lands every
// 6 us while printing one costs 10 us on the 2 Mbaud host port, so a long
// reply overflowed the one-byte buffer below. `97` is the standard's own
// pair — FI = 9 is Fi = 512, so `F/D = 8` — and the owner's word is that the
// card accepts it and talks at 1 Mbaud, a byte every 12 us, which the host
// port keeps up with. `PPS1` and `FAST_ETU_CYCLES` are parameters, and they
// must agree: `87` with 4, `97` with 8.
//
// ===================================================================
// WHAT IS CHECKED
// ===================================================================
//
// The activation sequence, the 8E2 framing and the receive path are CHECKED
// against the owner's own device — `docs/fpga-xray.md` has the measurement,
// including the fourteen-byte answer-to-reset it produced. **The transmit
// path and the PPS exchange have not run against a card yet**; they are
// verified in simulation against a model that echoes a correct PPS and,
// separately, one that does not.
