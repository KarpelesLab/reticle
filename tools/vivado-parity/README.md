# Vivado as the oracle

The scripts that ask Vivado 2026.1 what it does with designs written here, so
that Reticle can be held to the answer. None of it is needed to run the tests:
what they compare with is committed, under `testdata/fpga/vivado/`. Only
answers are committed, about designs written here; nothing of the vendor's
models or IP.

- `gen_cells.py` writes `src/fpga/devices/xc7_cells.v`.
- `gen_cell_vectors.py` asks `xsim` what each of those cells does, and writes
  `testdata/fpga/vivado/cells/`.
- `gen_primitives.py` writes one design per 7-series primitive into
  `testdata/fpga/vivado/primitives/`.
- `run_all.sh` and `run_vivado.tcl` run a directory of designs through Vivado;
  `run_reticle.sh` does the same with Reticle. Both run at the lowest priority.

`docs/fpga-vivado-parity.md` has what the answers say.
